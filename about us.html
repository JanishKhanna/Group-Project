            <h2>Soccer News on Social Media</h2> 
            <p>
                With the incredible emergence of modern-day technologies, it is no longer sufficient to base your presence on a sole platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                We at Soccernews.com are well aware of the fact that the internet industry is constantly evolving and that social networks are one of the fastest growing channels in the world. They are also the perfect way to spread the news, share your ideas and most importantly stay in touch with your audience and get a valuable feedback from your fans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the Soccernews.com team is doing its best to assert its presence at some of the most influential social networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soccernews.com official Facebook page is our frontrunner in the social media sphere as the world’s biggest and arguably the most powerful social network in the world has allowed us generate a huge fan base which goes well beyond 630,000 people who have liked what we do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soccernews.com are also present on Twitter where we attempt to stay ‘in the moment’ with over 8,000 people who we are interacting with daily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, having recognised the importance of the visual aspects of the job, we have also decided to join Instagram as well where our creative department is doing its best to add a unique visual appeal to our work.
