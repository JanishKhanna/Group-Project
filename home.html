                                Real Madrid and Barcelona like to outdo each other but this was just ridiculous.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the one, crazy evening in La Liga, the Catalans stumbled to a shameful 2-1 defeat at lowly Leganes before Real Madrid suffereed a humiliating 3-0 defeat at Sevilla, blowing the chance to move above their great rivals at the top of the table.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Both Leganes and Sevilla produced superb, electric performances and fully deserve the credit for their impressive victories against Spain’s top two.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the limp displays offered by Barcelona and Madrid – both beaten on the same day for the first time since January 4, 2015 – were remarkable in their own right.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On that day, Barcelona lost at David Moyes’s Real Sociedad, a defeat which sent shockwaves through the club and ultimately sparked the start of their charge towards the treble.
                            </p>
                            <p>        
                                The sad thing about this defeat, though, was that it was more predictable.

                                Well, he did not say, "No," and he did not say, "I’m out of here." For the Raptors, embarking on a  mega-gamble as this season starts with new star Kawhi Leonard in the fold, that’s a good start
                                
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                It’s also a low, low bar for what makes a successful media day press conference. But for the first time since the blockbuster trade that finally sent Leonard out of San Antonio, Leonard faced the tape-recorder crowd and was asked whether he plans to stick around in Toronto for the long haul.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I look at it as a day-to-day process," Leonard told the gathered Raptors media. "Like I said, my focus is on this year, this group that I have and striving to get to a championship. We all want to win. If you look to the future, you’re gonna trip over the present. So, I am focused on this year, tomorrow, and just keep going after that."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As an organization, the Raptors can accept this notion of living in the present. It’s all they can do. But the entirety of the NBA knows that Leonard can be a free agent in just a little more than nine months, and, off the record, most executives will say that Leonard is likely to bolt when July 1 hits, either for the Lakers or Clippers.

                                The Sharks positioned themselves to make a big splash this offseason, and wow did they ever make one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After missing out on the John Tavares sweepstakes (certainly not for a lack of effort), San Jose made the biggest blockbuster trade of the year by acquiring superstar defenseman Erik Karlsson from the Senators just before the start of training camp. It is an incredible score for general manager Doug Wilson because it not only brought his team one of the NHL’s best players, but they were able to do it without giving up any of their top prospects, any of their best young players, or really any asset that will factor into their NHL roster this season. It was a classic quantity over quality trade, and it could not have been scripted any better for the Sharks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With Karlsson now in the mix, the Sharks possess an embarrassment of riches on defense with their newest All-Star joining Brent Burns and Marc-Edouard Vlasic at the top of the roster. Other than maybe the Predators, there isn’t another defense in the league that can match that trio, and it’s certainly debatable as to whether or not the Predators have that much top-line talent.

                                Bangladesh's life in the Asia Cup 2018 has been about pain, and about largely finding routes for overcoming most of it. On the opening day, Tamim Iqbal was lost to a wrist fracture, and by the time they made it to the final Super Four game with still something to play for, Shakib Al Hasan couldn't play on any further due to his fractured finger.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's left Mushfiqur Rahim - a member of Bangladesh's most important batting trio - to do a lot all by himself. Bangladesh Cricket Board's decision to circumvent the captain of the side Mashrafe Mortaza and bring in top-order reinforcements in Imrul Kayes and Soumya Sarkar has worked in odd ways. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kayes has done well by adapting to his middle-order role and played the innings that kept Bangladesh alive. Sarkar's failure to bat well against Pakistan still raises question marks regarding his inclusion, but he bowled five crucial overs, and will remain crucial through his bit-part role in the absence of Shakib.
                            </p>

                                ndia's campaign reeks of an absolute contrast. They've strolled past oppositions and have put on display the gulf in quality between them and the rest.

                                Phillies manager Gabe Kapler's job may be safe for now, but general manager Matt Klentak says "significant changes" will be made to the organization going forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “There’s no other way to put it,” Klentak said before Wednesday's 14-0 loss to the Rockies (via NBC Sports). “We’ve played poorly. We’ve lost games. It’s been miserable for just about everybody up and down the organization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Significant changes are necessary. But I think we all need to fight the narrative that it’s a simple fix. There’s a lot of things we can do and we’re going to address a lot of things.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One aspect Klentak doesn't intend to change, though, is Philadelphia's manager. Despite leading the team to a 78-80 record entering Thursday with four games to play, Klentak is still confident in Kapler and gave credit to the growth he has made in his first season as a manager.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “I think Kap has been consistent throughout the year,” Klentak said. “I think he’s made plenty of adjustments. I think he’s learned a lot. I think he’s grown a lot. I think his style of in-game management has been relatively consistent."

                                Former WBC welterweight champion Victor Ortiz turned himself in to the Oxnard (Calif.) Police Department on Tuesday afternoon and was formally charged with three counts of felony sexual assault. He was released on $100,000 bail from the Ventura County Jail.

                                Ortiz (32-6-3, 25 KOs) was scheduled to face John Molina Jr. in the main event of a Premier Boxing Champions event Sunday at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, Calif.

                                After an initial report from an official connected to the PBC card said "he’s going to fight," Sporting News' Mark Ortega learned that the PBC is actively searching for a replacement opponent for Molina to face on Sunday.

                                The Ventura County District Attorney's Office charged Ortiz with forcible rape, forcible oral sex and forcible digital penetration. He is due in court Oct. 10.

                                According to the police report, on March 19, an adult female reported to the Oxnard Police Department that she was sexually assaulted inside a home. The department’s family protection unit immdediately opened an investigation. Investigators brought the charges to the District Attorney's Office, which led to a warrant being issued for Ortiz's arrest.

                                Week 4 gets exciting right away as two of last season's top teams in the NFC play on Thursday night.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Minnesota Vikings travel out west to take on the defending NFC West champs, the Los Angeles Rams. Both teams are expected by many to not only repeat their success from a year ago, but to also contend for the Super Bowl. The Vikings and Rams also made splashy moves this off-season as the Vikings signed Kirk Cousins to take over at quarterback with a fully guaranteed contract and the Rams added Ndamukong Suh, Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib to their defense.

                                What is arguably the sport's best rivalary takes place on Sunday night, where the Baltimore Ravens will face the Steelers in Pittsburgh. The Steelers are expected to be good again this year as they return their offensive playmakers from a year ago and most of their defense. But Baltimore on the other hand has a lot of questions, with the biggest one being whether or not this will be Joe Flacco's last season in Baltimore. A poor outing against a rival could lead to the once franchise quaterback to sitting on the bench.

                                SAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — Dustin Johnson moved back atop the world rankings this week after the Tour Championship. The notoriously mild-mannered golfer reacted to questions about the move as you’d expect, saying only, “Yeah, I like being one.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But before he can worry about staying at the top of that mountain, he has a Ryder Cup to defend this weekend at Le Golf National just outside of Paris.
                            <p>
                                Before the Tour Championship, Johnson was set to be Team USA’s most accomplished golfer in the last 10 years with 19 victories since 2008. That was until Tiger Woods won in Atlanta to close the PGA Tour season for his 19th win.

                                Again, Johnson handled that revelation with no particular vigor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I'm glad to see it, and I want to beat him at his best, and I feel like right now, he's starting to get back to where he's very good," he said. “So for me, especially when I first came out on Tour, I mean, that was a time when he was playing his best. To see him get back there after quite a while off I think is very impressive, and I'm glad to see it. I'm glad he's on my team this week, too.”

                                Carlos Ramos, the chair umpire who penalized Serena Williams during the women's U.S. Open Final last week, has finally spoken out about the incident.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ramos' decision to give Williams three code violations in the U.S. Open final, resulting in the loss of a game, told Portuguese newspaper Tribuna Expresso he is "fine" despite criticism for the way he handled the match.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “I’m fine, given the circumstances,” Ramos said, via the Associated Press. “It’s a delicate situation, but umpiring ‘a la carte’ doesn’t exist. Don’t worry about me.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The International Tennis Federation has defended Ramos for his actions during the final. The U.S. Open fined Williams for her three code violations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite the controversy, Ramos has been assigned to officiate the Davis Cup semifinal matches between the United States and Croatia this weekend.

                                Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Kyle Busch and Daniel Suarez will start at the rear of the pack Saturday at the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond Raceway.

                            <p>
                                Both drivers failed pre-race inspections which will drop them from their respective spots — Busch was slated to start 11th, Suarez fifth — on the starting grid, NASCAR announced Saturday.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Busch failed pre-race inspection for making unapproved adjustments to his vehicle. The team planned to make changes to his car after Busch scraped the wall during qualifying Friday.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He also started at the rear in Richmond in the first time at the track this season, but came back from 32nd to win the race.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Suarez won the first two stages of qualifying Friday, but finished with the fifth best qualifying time. His time was disallowed though after failing inspection.
